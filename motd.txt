<p>
Drowning I am, in the sea of sorrow,<br>
for the unknown destiny imprisons my soul.
</p>

<p>
Uncertain tomorrow,<br>
that question which answer<br>
I just could not find.
</p>

<p>
Though we haven't met for years,<br>
I can still see your smile<br>
very vividly,<br>
inside my mind.
</p>

<p>
Your beauty,<br>
embedded onto my conscience<br>
like patterns on a tapestry,<br>
permanent, undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
I yearn for the day we can finally be together,<br>
and the tapestry will weave itself<br>
until there is no space left in my head<br>
except for you.
</p>
