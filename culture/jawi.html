			Jawi is a writing system used for writing the Malay and other Malay-like languages. It's based on the Arabic script, which writing direction goes from right to left. The Jawi writing system consists of the original 29 arabic letters and 6 additional letters to fit the native Malay phonemes those are not found in Arabic. Today, Jawi is protected under Section 152 of the Federal Constitution and under Section 9 of the National Language Act 1963/1967 as it retains a degree of official use in religious and cultural administration. Businesses are mandated to adopt Jawi signages and billboards in some states.<br><br>
			Jawi is one of the earliest writing found, it expanded since the Pasai Islamic kingdom. Then spread to the Malacca, Johore and Acheh kingdom in the 17th century. Proof of the existence of this writing system in Malaysia is by the founding of the Batu Bersurat Terengganu which dated 702H (Islamic year) or 1303AC. While the earliest Roman writing found was on the end of teh 19th century. This shows that the Jawi writing has arrived to Malaysia earlier than the Roman writing. Jawi is an official writing system for non-affiliated states during the British rule. Written proof of the Declaration of Independence of Malaya was in Malay Jawi writing.
