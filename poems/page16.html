        	A pour of blessing
        	<br>
        	Tears of the sky
        	<br>
        	When droplets are dancing
        	<br>
        	They fall, from up high
        	<br>
        	Constant noises
        	<br>
        	Tappings, an orchestra
        	<br>

				Bond
			</div>
			<p>
			Days went by, realised
			<br>
			The blame, shall be put
			<br>
			Onto mineself,
			<br>
			My arrogance
			</p>

        	<p>
        	Dreamt of us, mesmerised
        	<br>
        	Was I cold, though it is but
        	<br>
        	An act, out of disturbance
        	<br>
        	My ignorance
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	Lovers, we used to be
        	<br>
        	Feelings, we used to keep
        	<br>
        	Lovesick, all night's lullaby
        	<br>
        	Our time, not one shall buy
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	Precious, dazzling as ruby
        	<br>
        	Distance, it cuts in deep
        	<br>
        	Tired, as time goes by
        	<br>
        	Our fear, to say goodbye
        	<br>
        	I need you
        	</p>

        	Rude! You're so rude!
        	<br>
        	Why can't you be polite
        	<br>
        	It's your attitude
        	<br>
        	You think you did it right
        	<br>
        	The manners, where are they?

        	I think you threw them away
