        	<p>
        	Though it's only a year
        	<br>
        	All the times were so dear
        	<br>
        	I will surely miss you here
        	<br>
        	In my heart you're always near
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	All the little things we share
        	<br>
        	All the memories we spare
        	<br>
        	All the ways you make me happy
        	<br>
        	No replace can make a copy
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	If this happens for the best
        	<br>
        	Then I'm up to all the rest
        	<br>
        	Know, one day I'll make you proud
        	<br>
        	That's one thing you'll never doubt
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	I am sorry to no count
        	<br>
        	If I ever let you down
        	<br>
        	I'll pray for you everyday
        	<br>
        	Hope you'll always find your way
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	I want just one thing to be
        	<br>
        	Please don't ever forget me
        	</p>

				Decision

        	<p>
        	A question that haunt
        	<br>
        	Confusion that taunts
        	<br>
        	Was not met with clue
        	<br>
        	'Bout risks, how it grew
        	<br>
        	For me to decide
        	<br>
        	Reveal what's inside
        	<br>
        	In God I confide
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	I ran back and forth
        	<br>
        	From South up to North
        	<br>
        	Just none who can tell
        	<br>
        	In riddles I fell
        	<br>
        	For once to think well
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	To choose, or to lose
        	<br>
        	To try or rely
        	<br>
        	To make, for your sake:
        	<br>
        	The Decision
        	</p>
