			Music

			Harmonious, beautiful

			Fiddling, blowing, beating

			Virtuoso, serenade, ensemble, score

				Childhood
			</div>
			<br>
			My childhood, as I remember
			<br>
			Melancholic, poignant, sombre
			<br>
			Grieving not, I am to be glad,
			<br>
			For childhood is not always sad
			<br>
			What is left, the memories I have
			<br>
			They shall bring me, a crying laugh

				My Heart
			</div>
			<br>
			She broke my heart
			<br>
			It's now mangled hard
			<br>
			She broke my heart
			<br>
			Sweet lies, oh so smart
			<br>
			She broke my heart
			<br>
			Her love was not sincere
			<br>
			She broke my heart
			<br>
			Slowly did it tear

				Death

        	Death
        	<br>
        	Macabre, morbid
        	<br>
        	Lying still, unable
        	<br>
        	Every soul's biggest fear
        	<br>
        	Mortal

				Saint
			</div>
        	<p>
        	You've been so hideously charming
        	<br>
        	so stunned, I couldn't see myself
        	<br>
        	Your presence seemed so alarming
        	<br>
        	those eyes forgot where they left
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	You're such a saint, oh I could faint
        	<br>
        	you look so just, so I gave you trust
        	<br>
        	And when I glanced, as you soar
        	<br>
        	it made me speechless to the core
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	No fear you bear, unbound to risks
        	<br>
        	went here and there, no one to miss
        	<br>
        	Each time you go, you make me cry
        	<br>
        	deep down you know, no use to lie
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	When the light starts to shade
        	<br>
        	love that binds turns to hate
        	<br>
        	Your time is up, now shall you pay
        	<br>
        	I can't be stopped, you can only pray
        	</p>
