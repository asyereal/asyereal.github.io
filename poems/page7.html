				Soul
			</div>
			<p>
			It felt so innocent
			<br>
			Until one temptation, lead to another
			<br>
			"Why would I bother?"
			<br>
			Calm not, satisfied neither
			<br>
        	What have I became? My soul is withered
        	<br>
        	Lost in darkness, swaying like feather
        	<br>
        	Don't be like me, I told my brother
        	<br>
        	I'm sorry, I cried to mother
        	<br>
        	It's already late, forgive me father
        	</p>

        	<p>
        	Long before it came
        	<br>
        	The thing, I call cause
        	<br>
        	I used to be tame
        	<br>
        	In mind never crossed
        	<br>
        	That things, wouldn't be same
        	<br>
        	In darkness, I'm so lost

				Hold
			</div>
			<br>
			Recall me?
			<br>
			I reckon, ye still do
			<br>
			On what we had, I hold
			<br>
			On what's perhaps, I hope
			<br>
			Yer presence, I miss you
			<br>
        	Just like silver, and it's cast
        	<br>
        	Firm do I hold, on out past

				Freedom
			</div>
			<br>
        	Out of bound, as I soar
        	<br>
        	Let me down, no they can't
        	<br>
        	Safe and sound, nothing more
        	<br>
        	Walk around, on my land;

        	<p>
        	Dreams of Palestine
        	<br>
        	Faith, in humankind
